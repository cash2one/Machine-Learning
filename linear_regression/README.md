#Linear Regression
###1.Background
    In statistics, linear regression is an approach for modeling the relationship between a scalar 
    
    dependent variable y and one or more explanatory variables (or independent variables) denoted X. 
    
    The case of one explanatory variable is called simple linear regression. For more than one explanatory 
    
    variable, the process is called multiple linear regression.
###2.Derivation
    
    here is going to show two kinds of derivation.
    
    (1) Gradient descent method
    (2) Least square method
