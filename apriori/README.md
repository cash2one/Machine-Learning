#Apriori
###1.Summary

    It is a association rule analysis algorithm. 
    
    Association rule means the rule of 2 item how to be difined have relationship.
    
    Confidence degree measure the intensity of association rule. How to calculate the 
    
    confidence degree of certain association rule. It is important to understand frequent item sets 
    
    and support degree.Frequent item sets means set of items which often appears together.
    
    Support degree equal the percent of frequent item sets in the entire data set.
    
    Assume the formalization of association rule is like " {A}-->{B} "
    
    Confidence degree equal the ratio of support of { A,B } to support of { B }.
    
    There always is a way to find all the association rules of data set, such as saving data in memery and looping.
    
    It costs lots of time when the number of items is huge (It must be huge.)
    
    The Apriori principle said that if a item set is a frequent item set, its super item set musst 
    
    be a frequent item set.
