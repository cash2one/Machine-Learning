#naive bayes classifier

1.Background

    First of all, make clear the characteristic of classification problem.
    
    Classification problem often use Empirical methods to construct the mapping rules.
    
    In general situation, classification problem is lack of enough infomation to construct 
    
    hundred percent correct mapping rules,
    
    but it will achieve a certain sense correct according to learning experience data.
    
    Secondly, make clear the bayes theorem.

    Among them, P(A|B) is the probability of the occurrence of A event when the B event occurs.
