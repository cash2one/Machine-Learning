#decision tree

1.background

    In real life, we will encounter this kind of problem.
    
    Some commodity's purchase have a certain relationship with customer's age,salary,and commodity prices. 
    
    We can get a table contains commodity's purchase information (yes / no) and age, salary, price. 
    
    Hope to predict another customer would buy a certain commodity whether or not. 
    
    In the situation, we present decision_tree algorithm.
    
2.definition

    In the situation of known all kinds of attribute probability of happening,
    
    Use attributes as decision node to build a tree and Use results as leaf node .
    
    There are many algorithm about building decision tree, such as ID3,CART.
    
    ID3 is a decision tree classification algorithm based on information entropy.
