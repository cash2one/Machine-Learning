#Regression Tree

###1.Background
    
    There is a decision tree algorithm based on ID3 algorithm in the Machine-Learning folder.
    
    It is a classification algorithm. It is the time o learn another tree algorithm which is called regression tree.
    
    It is used to solve the problem about non-linear regression.
    
    The core thinking of regression tree can be described by 2 steps.
    
    First, split the entire data into small data sets.
    
    Second, use suitable regression algorithm to fit the small data set.
